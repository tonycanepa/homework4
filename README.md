homework4 script

first upload - tried to update the html from last homework - attempt1

I quickly realized that I had changed all of my Div's to DIVID rather than DivClass which messed up my style sheet, will attempt another upload of the documents 

After being frustrated with GitHub not posting what I was seeing on my HTML viewer, I was advised that it takes a few minutes for it to load. I also went in and edited my features because I have several identical points as vertices for my polygons so I changed that. I also added popups with fake names to show "where my friends live"
