<h1>Grocery Store Locations in Chicago Neighborhoods and Number of Households</h1>
<p>This map was created to help identify which neighborhoods are in need for more grocery stores to fulfill the needs of the households that live there. Further analysis will be done to identify the population densities of each neighborhood, as well as an audit of the grocery store data to ensure up to date information</p>
